# Components

This directory contains all reusable UI components for the Asocial platform.

## Organization

Components should be organized by feature or type:

- `feed/` - Feed-related components (posts, comments, etc.)
- `ui/` - Generic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (header, sidebar, etc.)
- `theme/` - Theme-specific components (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram styles)

## Guidelines

- Each component should be self-contained
- Use TypeScript for prop types
- Follow SvelteKit conventions
- Keep components small and focused
